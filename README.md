## Abstract

In the winter of 1862, residents of Nebraska City, Nebraska Territory, killed two alleged horse thieves. The vigilantes executed one man with a shot to the back, and forced the other under the frozen waters of the Missouri river, holding him there until he drowned. The local paper turned the grim scene into a joke, and, in a winking condemnation of the victim being “chucked under the ice,” concluded that the killing was “murderous, unwarrantable, and very cold.” The callous humor is not entirely surprising. Killing, once rare in American extralegal violence, had by the time of the Civil War increasingly emerged as both a powerful tool and a potent ritual in the tradition of “politics out of doors.”

 This article, “‘Murderous, Unwarrantable, and Very Cold’: Killing and Extralegal Collective Violence in the United States, 1783-1865” uses geospatial analysis to investigate and narrate the rise of the use of lethal force within the tradition of extralegal violence in the United States. Rather than a mindless or undirected outburst, extralegal collective violence is a form of violent social communication in which bodies become both the instruments and the canvas through which a group expresses its aims. A mob’s unsanctioned hanging of a gambler, for example, could not itself end the practice of gambling, but would successfully communicate the mob’s position to authorities, bystanders, and targets. To interpret the communicative properties of lethal extralegal violence, the data behind this article must be queried not as a series of disconnected flashes, but as a relational phenomenon that draws its strength from a common intelligibility. An approach grounded in digital history offers the unique opportunity to query hundreds of instances of extralegal violence in order to better understand the role that killing played in the early history of American popular crowd action. Geospatial analysis will investigate change over both time and space, moving past the political container of state borders to interrogate local, regional, and national trends within extralegal violence.

 The three-layered article structure proposed by the Journal of Digital History is ideal for this submission. Every data point is both a story unto itself, and, when viewed as a collection, a part of larger stories and narratives. This data represents the fundamental building blocks for the article’s approach, and being able to share that data in a transparent way is immensely compelling. In the hermeneutics layer, the article will highlight the process behind identifying the patterns and trends in lethal extralegal action. A central theme of the article’s argument concerns relationships between seemingly disparate or random violent actions. Spatial analysis, made possible by digital tools, is key to spying these relationships and the patterns they create. Data and hermeneutics drive the narration layer. There, the article will combine research-driven argumentation with dynamic storytelling powered by interactive maps and visualizations. This will enable readers to both focus on individual actions and step back to view the larger pointillist pictures brought into focus when viewing larger sets of the data.
